## What?
This consists of three scripts that can be used to generate NovelAI training data from 4chan archived threads:
	- scraper.py, which downloads a list of all threads matching a given arch.b4k.co search result
	- dumper.py, which downloads all threads generated by scraper.py
	- cleaner.py, which parses, cleans, and reformats the threads dumped by dumper.py

## Instructions
1) Search b4k archive for the threads you want to train a module on, then copy the URL
	- Be sure to select Only Opening Posts
	- Your URL should look something like: https://arch.b4k.co/vg/search/subject/%2Faids%2F/type/op/
2) Paste URL into scraper.py's `BASE_URL`, then save the script.
3) Open your terminal and run `python scraper.py`
	- This will generate a file `output.txt` containing all of the threads matching your search
4) Open your terminal and run `python dumper.py`
	- This will download the HTML for every thread listed in `output.txt` and write it to disk
5) Create a folder called `cleaned` in the same folder as the scripts
5) Open your terminal and run `python cleaner.py`
	- This will parse the downloaded HTML files, clean them, and write cleaned text files to the `cleaned` folder
